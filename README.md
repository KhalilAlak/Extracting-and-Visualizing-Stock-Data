# Extracting-and-Visualizing-Stock-Data
# Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Coursera course **"Python Project for Data Science"** offered by IBM. The goal is to analyze and visualize the historical stock prices and quarterly revenue data of two public companies — **Tesla (TSLA)** and **GameStop (GME)** — using Python, web scraping, and data visualization libraries.

The final deliverable includes code to:
- Extract stock price data using the `yfinance` library
- Scrape quarterly revenue data from HTML pages using `BeautifulSoup`
- Clean and structure the data using `pandas`
- Create dual-axis line plots using `matplotlib` to show price vs. revenue trends

## Tools & Libraries Used
- `yfinance` – to extract historical stock price data
- `requests` – to fetch HTML pages for revenue data
- `BeautifulSoup` – to parse and extract data from HTML
- `pandas` – for data manipulation and cleaning
- `matplotlib` – to plot stock price and revenue on a dashboard
